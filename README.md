FlatUI
======

I wanted a cool and light colorscheme. Instead of trying to come up with my own
colors, I decided to piggy-back on the work done on [flatuicolors.com](http://flatuicolors.com).

Work in progress. Constantly changing.
Use a plugin manager to keep up.

**Note**: All screenshots taken using terminal Vim, and using the
[vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) theme "luna".
